Feature: Bind

  A service can be bound to a container.

  Background: Having a container
    Given a container

    Rule: container acknowledges a binding

      Scenario: A binding is acknowledged after being bound to a container
        Given a service "service-id" binding to constant value
        When binding is bound to container
        Then container acknowledges binding to be bound

    Rule: container binds in the expected scope

      Scenario: A binding is bound to a container and two requests are resolved according to the binding scope
        Given a service "service-id" binding to dynamic value in <binding_scope> scope
        When binding is bound to container
        And container gets a "first" value for service "service-id"
        And container gets a "second" value for service "service-id"
        Then "first" and "second" values are <equality>

        Examples:
          | binding_scope | equality |
          | "Request"     | distinct |
          | "Singleton"   | equal    |
          | "Transient"   | distinct |

      Scenario: A binding is bound to a container and two sub requests are resolved according to the binding scope
        Given a sword type binding as "sword" in <binding_scope> scope
        And a service "service-id" dual wield swordsman type binding
        When "sword" binding is bound to container
        And binding is bound to container
        And container gets a value for service "service-id"
        Then dual wield swordsman swords are <equality>

        Examples:
          | binding_scope | equality |
          | "Request"     | equal    |
          | "Singleton"   | equal    |
          | "Transient"   | distinct |

# Snapshot

Snapshots can save the state in an specific moment in time within your Inversify container. These snapshots capture the state of your container at a particular point, allowing you to revert back to that state if needed.

Think of it as taking a picture of your container, enabling you to preserve and restore the exact configurations and dependencies that were present when the snapshot was taken. This can be incredibly useful for debugging, testing, or simply for keeping track of changes made to your container over time.

By creating snapshots of your Inversify container, you can easily roll back to a previous working state or compare different configurations without having to manually recreate them. This functionality can save you time and effort, ultimately making your development process smoother and more efficient.

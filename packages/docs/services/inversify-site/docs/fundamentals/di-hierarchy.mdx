# DI Hierarchy
InversifyJS is a popular library for implementing inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injection (DI) in TypeScript applications. It also supports hierarchical dependency injection, which can be a powerful tool in complex applications.

With InversifyJS hierarchical injection system, you can create a hierarchy of containers where each container can have a parent container. This allows for better organization and separation of concerns in your application.

When a dependency needs to be injected, InversifyJS starts by looking in the current container for a binding. If the binding is not found, it moves up the hierarchy to the parent container and continues the search. This process continues until the dependency is resolved or the top-level parent container is reached.

By using InversifyJS hierarchical injection system, you can easily manage complex dependencies and keep your code clean and modular. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for handling dependencies in your TypeScript applications.

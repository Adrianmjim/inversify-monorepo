# Inheritance

Inheritance can be accomplished as long as constructor parameters are properly decorated. There're two ways to have constructor parameters properly decorated:

- The number of decorated constructor arguments in a derived class is greater or equal than the number of constructor arguments in its base class.
- [skipBaseClassChecks](/docs/api/container#skipbaseclasschecks) option is enabled

## Example of wrong inheritance injection

```ts
@injectable()
class Warrior {
  public rank: string;
  constructor(rank: string) { // args count  = 1
    this.rank = rank;
  }
}

@injectable()
class SamuraiMaster extends Warrior {
  constructor() { // args count = 0
    super("master");
  }
}
```

When trying to get a `SamuraiMaster`, the container throws an Error alerting the constructor parameters are not properly decorated.

## Using @unmanaged decorator

The [unmanaged](/docs/api/decorator#unmanaged) decorator is a good way to tell inversify a base type constructor param is should not be managed. This is often the case when dealing with inheritance hierarchies in which only leaf types are injected.

```ts
@injectable()
class Warrior {
  public rank: string;
  constructor(@unmanaged() rank: string) { // args count  = 0, unmanaged args are not included
    this.rank = rank;
  }
}

@injectable()
class SamuraiMaster extends Warrior {
  constructor() { // args count = 0
    super("master");
  }
}
```

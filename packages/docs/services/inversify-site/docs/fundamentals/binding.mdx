# Binding

A binding represents a relation between a service identifier and a service resolution. Bindings are added to a container in order to configure it to provide services.

## Binding properties

A binding has the following properties:

### Service identifier

Identifier of the service to provide a resolution.

### Scope

The scope is an alias of a caching strategy to decide whether or not the service should be resolved instead of provide a cached value.

#### Request

Sets the binding scope to request. Whenever the service is resolved in the same `container.get` request, the same resolved value will be used.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{bindingScopeRequestSource}</CodeBlock>

#### Singleton

Whenever the service is resolved, the same cached resolved value will be used.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{bindingScopeSingletonSource}</CodeBlock>

#### Transient

Whenever the service is resolved, a different resolved value will be used.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{bindingScopeTransientSource}</CodeBlock>

### Constraint

Whether or not the binding is used to provide a resolved value for the given service identifier. Consider [API docs](/docs/api/binding-syntax#bindingwhensyntax) as reference.

### Lifecycle handlers

Handlers to be called after a resolved value is provided or a singleton scoped binding is deactivated.

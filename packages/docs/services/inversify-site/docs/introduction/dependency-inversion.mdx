# Dependency inversion

In order to apply the dependency inversion principle, we can rely on injection symbols:

<CodeBlock language="ts">{dependencyInversionSource}</CodeBlock>

By using symbols this way we can provide interface implementations in a way the dependent class is not aware of the dependency implementation details.

:::note

Even if symbols are suggested for this purpose, InversifyJS supports the usage of Classes and string literals as service identifiers as well.

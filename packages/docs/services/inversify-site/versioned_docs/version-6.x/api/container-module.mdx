# ContainerModule

Container modules help manage the complexity of bindings in large applications.

## Constructor

```ts
constructor(registry: interfaces.ContainerModuleCallBack)
```

The constructor argument for `ContainerModule` is a registration callback with function parameters to manage bindings within the scope of the container module.

### bind

```ts
bind: interfaces.Bind
```

Refer to the [docs](./container.mdx#bind) for more information.

### unbind

```
unbind: interfaces.Unbind
```

Refer to the [docs](./container.mdx#unbind) for more information.

### isBound

```ts
isBound: interfaces.IsBound
```

Refer to the [docs](./container.mdx#isbound) for more information.

### rebind

```ts
rebind: interfaces.Rebind
```

Refer to the [docs](./container.mdx#rebind) for more information.

### unbindAsync

```ts
unbindAsync: interfaces.UnbindAsync
```

Refer to the [docs](./container.mdx#unbindasync) for more information.

### onActivation

```ts
onActivation: interfaces.Container['onActivation']
```

Refer to the [docs](./container.mdx#onactivation) for more information.

### onDeactivation

```ts
onDeactivation: interfaces.Container['onDeactivation']
```

Refer to the [docs](./container.mdx#ondeactivation) for more information.

## Example: binding services through ContainerModule API

When a container module is loaded into a Container, the registration callback is invoked. This is the opportunity for the container module to register bindings and handlers. Use the Container `load` method for `ContainerModule` instances and the Container `loadAsync` method for `AsyncContainerModule` instances.

When a container module is unloaded from a Container, the bindings added by that container will be removed, and the [deactivation process](../fundamentals/lifecycle/deactivation.mdx) will occur for each of them. Container deactivation and [activation handlers](../fundamentals/lifecycle/activation.mdx) will also be removed. Use the `unloadAsync` method to unload when there will be an async deactivation handler or async [preDestroy](./decorator.mdx#predestroy).

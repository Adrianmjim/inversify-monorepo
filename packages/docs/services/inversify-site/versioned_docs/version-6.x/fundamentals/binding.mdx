# Binding

A binding represents the relationship between a service identifier and its resolution. Bindings are added to a container to configure it to provide services.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{fundamentalsBindingExample}</CodeBlock>

When the binding is added to the container, the container is configured to provide a resolved value for the service identifier `Weapon` by resolving the `Katana` class. `container.bind` creates a new binding with certain properties, which are explained below.

## Binding properties

A binding has the following properties:

### Service identifier

The identifier of the service for which a resolution is provided.

### Scope

The scope determines the caching strategy used to decide whether the service should be resolved or a cached value should be provided.

#### Request

When the service is resolved within the same `container.get` request, the same resolved value will be used.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{bindingScopeRequestSource}</CodeBlock>

#### Singleton

When the service is resolved, the same cached resolved value will be used.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{bindingScopeSingletonSource}</CodeBlock>

#### Transient

When the service is resolved, a new resolved value will be used each time.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{bindingScopeTransientSource}</CodeBlock>

### Constraint

Specifies whether the binding is used to provide a resolved value for the given service identifier. Refer to the [API docs](/docs/api/binding-syntax#bindingwhensyntax) for more information.

### Lifecycle handlers

Handlers that are called after a resolved value is provided or a singleton-scoped binding is deactivated. Refer to the [API docs](/docs/api/binding-syntax#bindingonsyntax) for more information.

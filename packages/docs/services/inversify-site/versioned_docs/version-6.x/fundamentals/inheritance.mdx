# Inheritance

Inheritance can be achieved as long as constructor parameters are properly decorated. There are two ways to ensure this:

- The number of decorated constructor arguments in a derived class is greater than or equal to the number of constructor arguments in its base class.
- The [skipBaseClassChecks](/docs/api/container#skipbaseclasschecks) option is enabled.

## Example of incorrect inheritance injection

```ts
@injectable()
class Warrior {
  public rank: string;
  constructor(rank: string) { // args count = 1
    this.rank = rank;
  }
}

@injectable()
class SamuraiMaster extends Warrior {
  constructor() { // args count = 0
    super("master");
  }
}
```

When trying to get a `SamuraiMaster`, the container throws an error indicating that the constructor parameters are not properly decorated.

## Using the @unmanaged decorator

The [unmanaged](/docs/api/decorator#unmanaged) decorator tells Inversify that a base type constructor parameter should not be managed. This is often the case when dealing with inheritance hierarchies where only leaf types are injected.

```ts
@injectable()
class Warrior {
  public rank: string;
  constructor(@unmanaged() rank: string) { // args count = 0, unmanaged args are not included
    this.rank = rank;
  }
}

@injectable()
class SamuraiMaster extends Warrior {
  constructor() { // args count = 0
    super("master");
  }
}
```
